description: Enforce project code standards when writing code
---

## Workflow

1. Determine the language of the code being written or reviewed
2. Read the relevant standards file from `languages/` (e.g., `languages/ts.md` for TypeScript)
3. Apply all standards when writing new code or reviewing existing code
4. When reviewing, flag violations with the specific rule and a suggested fix

## Supported Languages

- **TypeScript / TSX**: See [languages/ts.md](languages/ts.md) for all rules
