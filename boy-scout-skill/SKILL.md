description: Analyses an implementation plan, trying to improve it

## What I do

1. Ask user for analysis name
2. Look for that analysis in .opencode/skill/task-analysis-skill/analyses
3. Read it to get context
4. Read through the files in the codebase mentioned in the analysis to get more context
5. Read the Boy scout rules below

## Boy scout rules

1. First ask the user if he has his own insights for the analysis. Take into account his comments for further improvements.
2. Understand the business case of the project
3. For the analysis we're currently considering suggest improvements
4. Think about what could be done better
5. Think about how we could improve the code for the future
6. What security and performance issues we could make together with the changes
7. How can we improve the product for the end users?
8. What UX issues can we solve?
9. Move to implementation section

## Implementation

1. For the analysis we're focusing on, make a copy called '[existing-analysis-name]-improved'
